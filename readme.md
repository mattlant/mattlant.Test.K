# mattlant.Test.K - A Coding Skills Test Program #

This project is a solution for a problem presented to me for an interview.

## Notes ##
- I chose C# as I have the most extensive experience with it.
- I chose .NET Core 3.1 as it is cross platform and reviewers may be using 
Windows, MacOS, or Linux, and can be easily reviewed and executed in VS Code.
- I developed this project in Visual Studio Community with jetBrains Resharper extension. 
- I chose to recreate simple versions of 3rd party frameworks I could have used, 
such as a DI container. 
I did this to show a codebase that is not so shallow.
- I went much further than just a quick solution to the narrowly scoped problem 
to show something that would be a bit more real-world.
- I limited test coverage for this coding test. 
- I uploaded to GitHub because everyone wants to see your massive portfolio of 
work online these days ;-P.
- Extra notes can be found in remarks tags in xml doc comments.
